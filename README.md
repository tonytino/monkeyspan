## Contributing

_Please note that this project follows the practices of [Semantic Versioning] and maintaining a [CHANGELOG]._

### Making Changes

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start up Storybook for a live development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

3. Make your changes

4. Test them in Storybook and/or using a separate app (e.g `npx create-react-app demo`):

   If you want to test your changes in a separate app, [Yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) is a fantastic tool for linking purposes.

   ```bash
   # in this project's root directory, run
   yalc publish

   # then in the root directory of the app you're using to demo this package, run:
   yalc link monkeyspan && npm i && npm run start
   ```

   You should now be able to use the package in that app, e.g.

   ```jsx
   import { MonkeySpan } from "monkeyspan";
   ```

5. Make sure your changes haven't broken anything:

   Run the tests and linting.

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   Ensure the build will generate successfully.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. Commit your changes and merge them to the `main` branch

7. See [Publishing Releases](#publishing-releases)

### Publishing Releases

_Please note that the following should be done on the `main` branch, except for under certain circumstances, e.g. patching an older version than the last._

In order to generate a release, you need to produce a new package version and a corresponding tag for said version.

For example, let's say you want to add a component or feature to this package.

To do so, you'd simply add your component/feature, commit your work, then produce your version via:

1. Determine what type of changes you've made per [Semantic Versioning] to identify what the next version for this package will be. Check the [`package.json`](./package.json)'s current version to begin.
2. Add an entry to the [CHANGELOG]
3. Run the following command with your new version in place of `<VERSION>`:

   ```bash
   npm run tag --value=<VERSION>
   ```

   If it was successful, you'll get a link like `https://github.com/tonytino/monkeyspan/releases/tag/<VERSION>` at the end of output.

4. Go to the URL provided by the script output to see your new release in GitHub.

5. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/tonytino/monkeyspan/actions) for this project and you should see a job running for your release, which, if successful, will upload your new version of this package to [npm].
