### Making Changes

_For now, the only way to contribute to this package with visibility into the changes is via linking. [Yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) is a fantastic tool for this purpose._

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Make changes and bundle them using:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Test them using a separate app (e.g `npx create-react-app demo`):

   ```bash
   # in this project's root directory, run
   yalc publish

   # then in the root directory of the app you're using to demo this package, run:
   yalc link monkeyspan && npm run start
   ```

   You should now be able to use the package in that app, e.g.

   ```jsx
   import { MonkeySpan } from "monkeyspan";
   ```

### Available Scripts

| Command | Params | Example | Purpose
| - | - | - | - |
| build | none | `npm run build` | Runs `npm run build:rollup` |
| build:rollup | none | `npm run build:rollup` | Generates a build and source map (`bundle.js` & `bundle.js.map`) using Rollup & Babel. |
| clean | none | `npm run clean` | Runs `npm run clean:eslint` and `npm run clean:prettier` |
| clean:eslint | none | `npm run clean:eslint` | Runs `npx eslint --fix .`, which attempts to resolve all eslint issues in the project. |
| clean:prettier | none | `npm run clean:prettier` | Runs `npx prettier --write .`, which attempts to resolve all prettier issues in the project. |
| tag | `--value` | `npm run tag --value=1.2.3` | Runs `npm run tag:set --value=<value>` and `npm run tag:release --value=<value>` |
| tag:set | `--value` | `npm run tag:set --value=1.2.3` | Runs `npx json -I -f ./package.json -e 'this.version=\"$npm_config_value\"' && npm i && git ci -am \"$npm_config_value\" && git tag $npm_config_value`, which updates the `package.json` version to the value provided, updates the `package-lock.json`, generates a commit for the changes, and tags the commit using the value provided. |
| tag:release | `--value` | `npm run tag:release --value=1.2.3` | Runs `git push origin $npm_config_value && gh release create $npm_config_value --title \"$npm_config_value\"`, which pushes the tag value provided to GitHub, then produces a release for it using the `gh` cli. _You will need the [gh cli](https://github.com/cli/cli) for this command to work._ |
| test | none | `npm run test` | Runs `npm run test:eslint` and `npm run test:prettier` |
| test:babel | none | `npm run test:babel` | Runs `npx babel src --out-dir .babel-config-test/`, providing a glimpse at how babel's current config transforms the src code. Find the output in `.babel-config-test/`. |
| test:eslint | none | `npm run test:eslint` | Runs `npx eslint .`, providing info about issues. |
| test:prettier | none | `npm run test:prettier` | Runs `npx prettier --check .`, providing info about issues. |
| release | TAG (e.g. 1.2.3) | `TAG=1.2.3 npm run release` | Generates a git tag using the TAG supplied, and pushes it to GitHub, then provides a link to follow to create a release in GitHub for the new tag. *If the script fails, check the git log to see if a commit was created. If so, you'll have to undo the commit if you want to run the script again. Simply run the following to do so:*  `git reset HEAD\^` |

### Publishing Releases

In order to generate a release, you need to produce a new package version and a corresponding tag for said version.

For example, let's say you want to add a component to this package.

To do so, you'd simply add your component, commit your work, then produce your version via:

1. Open `package.json` and update the `version` accordingly (e.g. `1.2.3` to `1.3.0`).
2. Run the following command with your new version in place of `<VERSION>`:

   ```bash
   TAG=<VERSION> npm run release
   ```

   If it was successful, you'll get a link like https://github.com/tonytino/monkeyspan/releases/new?tag=YOUR_VERSION&title=YOUR_VERSION in the output. Look for the rocket: 🚀

   _If the `release` script fails, check the git log to see if a commit was created. If so, you'll have to undo the commit if you want to run the script again. Simply run the following to do so:_

   ```bash
   git reset HEAD\^
   ```

3. Go to the URL provided by the `release` script output, and make a release for your new version (a tag was produced by the `release` script using the version you provided).

4. Once the release is created, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/tonytino/monkeyspan/actions) for this project and you should see a job running for your release, which, if successful, will upload your new version of this package to JFrog. Note that it takes a minute or so for JFrogs API to reflect the successful upload.
